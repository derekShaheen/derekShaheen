<h2 align="center">Systems-focused senior software engineer</h2>

<p align="center">
I design and build deterministic systems that operate under real-world constraints —  
from high-volume data pipelines to game AI, simulations, and tooling.
</p>

## 🧠 What I Work On

I specialize in turning complex, constraint-heavy problems into maintainable, observable systems.

- Backend-heavy application logic and data pipelines
- Performance-critical SQL and data modeling
- Simulation, automation, and AI decision systems
- Developer tooling and visualization for debugging complex behavior

My professional work involves real world large-scale operational systems.  
Public repositories focus on tooling, simulations, and exploratory systems.

## 🧩 Public Work Themes

### Systems & Data Engineering
- High-throughput SQL Server development
- Data validation, sequencing, and state management
- Set-based refactors of legacy procedural logic
- Observability-driven design (debug flags, traceability, visual validation)

### Simulation, AI & Automation
- Unity-based AI behavior systems (navigation, avoidance, prioritization)
- Swarm and group behavior modeling
- Runtime patching and instrumentation (Harmony / BepInEx)
- Deterministic decision logic over heuristic black boxes

### Visualization & Exploration
- Browser-based simulations (Canvas / WebGL)
- Shader-driven visual debugging
- Interactive tools to reason about invisible systems

## ⚙️ Engineering Principles

- Deterministic systems are easier to debug than clever ones
- Make behavior visible before optimizing it
- Replace procedural sprawl with data-driven pipelines
- Prefer correctness and observability over premature abstraction
- Refactor toward simplicity, not minimal lines of code
